# IOM-NN
IOM-NN (Iterative Opinion Mining using Neural Networks) is a software for discovering the polarization of social media users during election campaigns characterized by the competition of political factions. The methodology uses an automatic incremental procedure based on feed-forward neural networks for analyzing the posts published by social media users. Starting from a limited set of classification rules, created from a small subset of hashtags that are notoriously in favor of specific factions, the methodology iteratively generates new classification rules. Such rules are then used to determine the polarization of people towards a faction.
